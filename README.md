sbt-svelte
===========

sbt-svelte integrates Webpack + Svelte into Playframework's asset generation. 

It eliminates the need to run a separate node process to hot-reload your Svelte code. Moreover, it enables you to mix between SPA and non-SPA pages in your application; it's your choice whether to use SPA or not.

It works with both `sbt run` (and hot reloading the code changes) and `sbt stage`.

Please see the example project in the folder `test-play-project`.
